# Tax Compliance - Employee Categories by Province

## Feature Enhancement

Enhanced the Tax Compliance section in Data Export to provide detailed breakdown by both employee category and province for more accurate tax reporting.

## What Changed

### Before

- Tax compliance showed only employee categories (Employee, DSP, Contractor)
- Single aggregated view across all provinces
- Limited provincial tax reporting capability

### After

- **Province-specific breakdown**: Each employee category broken down by province
- **Dual view**: Detailed provincial view + summary totals
- **Enhanced tax reporting**: Better compliance for multi-provincial operations

## New Data Structure

### Employee Categories by Province

- **Category**: Employee type (Employee T4, DSP Contractor, etc.)
- **Province**: Specific province where work was performed
- **Count**: Number of employees who worked in that province/category
- **Hours**: Total hours worked in that province/category
- **Cost**: Labor costs for that province/category
- **Revenue**: Revenue generated from that province/category
- **GST Collected**: GST amount for contractor payments in that province
- **Tax Treatment**: T4 vs T4A classification

## UI Improvements

### Enhanced Table Display

#### Main Table: Province Breakdown

- **Province column**: Shows specific province for each category entry
- **Sorted display**: Alphabetical by category, then by province
- **Color-coded badges**: Category badges + province outline badges
- **Complete details**: All financial data by province/category combination

#### Summary Table: Category Totals

- **Aggregate view**: Totals across all provinces for each category
- **Highlighted styling**: Distinguished background for summary rows
- **Reference totals**: Easy comparison with detailed breakdown

## CSV Export Enhancements

## Benefits for Tax Compliance

### Multi-Provincial Operations

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing

```typescript
// Create province-category breakdown
const employeeCategoriesByProvince = employees.reduce((acc, emp) => {
  const category = emp.category || "employee";
  const empEntries = billableTimeEntries.filter((e) => e.employeeId === emp.id);

  // Group by province for this employee
  const entriesByProvince = empEntries.reduce((provAcc, entry) => {
    const province = provinces.find((p) => p.id === entry.provinceId);
    const provinceName = province?.name || "Unknown Province";
    // ... aggregate by province
  });
  // ... rest of processing
});
```

### Backward Compatibility

- **Legacy support**: Original `employeeCategories` structure maintained
- **Existing reports**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Gradual migration**: New detailed view supplements existing summaries

## Use Cases
