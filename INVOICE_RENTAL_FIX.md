# Invoice Rental Billable Fix

## Issue Fixed

The "total billable" amounts in the Invoice Management section were not correctly reflecting rental revenue.

## Root Cause

In `src/components/InvoiceManagement.tsx`, the rental billable calculation was using the wrong property:

**Before (Incorrect)**:

```typescript
const rentalBillable = dayRentalEntries.reduce(
  (sum, entry) => sum + entry.totalCost, // ❌ Using DSP costs instead of client revenue
  0,
);
```

**After (Fixed)**:

```typescript
const rentalBillable = dayRentalEntries.reduce(
  (sum, entry) => sum + entry.totalBillable, // ✅ Using client revenue
  0,
);
```

## Explanation

### Rental Entry Properties:

- `totalCost`: What you pay to DSPs (costs)
- `totalBillable`: What you charge clients (revenue)

### Problem:

The invoice totals were showing rental costs instead of rental revenue, leading to:

- Lower total billable amounts than expected
- Incorrect profit calculations
- Inaccurate invoice summaries

### Solution:

Changed the calculation to use `entry.totalBillable` for revenue calculations, ensuring:

- ✅ Total billable correctly includes rental revenue
- ✅ Invoice summaries show accurate amounts
- ✅ Profit calculations are correct (Revenue - Costs)

## Impact

Now the Invoice Management section will correctly show:

- **Total Billable**: Labor revenue + Rental revenue (what you charge clients)
- **Job Statistics**: Accurate totals including rental revenue
- **Date Breakdowns**: Proper rental revenue per day
- **Payment Tracking**: Correct amounts for invoiced/paid tracking

## Files Changed

- `src/components/InvoiceManagement.tsx` - Fixed rental billable calculation on line ~180
